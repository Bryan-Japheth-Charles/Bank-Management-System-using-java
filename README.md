Bank Management System
The Bank Management System is a comprehensive Java application designed to manage various banking operations through a graphical user interface (GUI). This system combines the power of Java Swing for an interactive user experience and SQL for secure and efficient data storage.

Key Functionalities
Account Management

Create Accounts: Users can add new customer accounts by entering details such as name, address, contact information, and initial deposit.
View Accounts: Users can view details of all existing accounts, including account number, holder's name, and current balance.
Delete Accounts: Users can delete customer accounts that are no longer needed.
Transaction Processing

Deposits: The system allows users to deposit money into any customer account. The balance is updated in real-time.
Withdrawals: Users can withdraw money from customer accounts. The system checks for sufficient balance before processing withdrawals.
Transfers: The system supports transferring funds between accounts. Both the source and destination accounts are updated accordingly.
Transaction History

View History: Users can view the detailed transaction history of each account, including dates, types (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), and amounts.
Export History: Optionally, transaction histories can be exported for further analysis or record-keeping.
Search and Filter

Search Accounts: Users can search for accounts based on criteria such as account number, holder's name, or address.
Filter Accounts: Accounts can be filtered based on balance ranges or account types (savings, current, etc.), allowing users to quickly find specific groups of accounts.
Technical Details
Java Swing for GUI

User-Friendly Interface: Java Swing provides a set of components such as buttons, text fields, labels, and tables, which are used to create an intuitive interface.
Event Handling: The system responds to user actions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) through event listeners, ensuring a responsive user experience.
SQL for Data Storage

Database Management: The application uses an SQL database to store all account and transaction data securely.
CRUD Operations: SQL queries are used for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, allowing efficient management of data.
Data Integrity: Foreign keys, transactions, and other database constraints ensure data integrity and consistency.
Integration

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is used to connect the Java application to the SQL database, enabling execution of SQL queries from within the Java code.
Prepared Statements: For security and efficiency, prepared statements are used to prevent SQL injection attacks and to handle complex queries.
